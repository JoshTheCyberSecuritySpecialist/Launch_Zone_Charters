      question: "What should I bring for the rocket launch tour?",
      answer: "We recommend bringing water, sunscreen, a light jacket (evenings can get cool on the water), a camera, and any snacks you might want. We provide life jackets and all necessary safety equipment."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best time to see the bioluminescence?",
      answer: "The best time is around the new moon when the sky is darkest, typically from May through November. The bioluminescent organisms are most active in warmer months, with peak activity usually in August and September."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the tours kid-friendly?",
      answer: "Yes, both our rocket launch and bioluminescent tours are family-friendly. Children ages 5 and up are welcome. We provide appropriately sized life jackets for all passengers including children."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need kayaking experience for the bioluminescent tour?",
      answer: "No prior experience is needed. Our guides provide comprehensive instructions before launching, and the waters we paddle are typically calm. We use stable, easy-to-maneuver kayaks appropriate for beginners."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a rocket launch is scrubbed or delayed?",
      answer: "Rocket launches can be delayed or scrubbed due to weather or technical issues. If a launch is scrubbed before your tour, we'll contact you to reschedule or offer a refund. If scrubbed during the tour, we apply our 'Scrub Policy' which includes a discount on a future tour."
    },
    {
      question: "How close do we get to the rocket launches?",
      answer: "Our boats position at the closest safe viewing distance permitted by the Coast Guard, typically 3-5 miles from the launch pad. This provides an exceptional view while ensuring safety."
